# Git-It-Done
Search for a GitHub user or click on a language to see a list of all repositories and how many open issues they have.

## Lesson 1
* Learned that a server-side API is an interface for accessing another website's data.
* Familiarized yourself with how to read server-side API documentation and why they often give examples using 'curl'
* Made requests to a server-side API with the browser's Fetch API.
* Used the DevTools Network tab to glean additional information about requests being made.

## Lesson 2
* Capture user input from the browser to create dynamic HTTP requests.
* Use an HTTP request's response to display data to a user.
* Handle errors that may occur when working with server-side APIs.

## Lesson 3
* Learned that request and response headers contain additional information about the request, separate from the data itself - like GitHub's Link header that lets you know there are more pages of results to request.
* Leveraged a new GitHub API endpoint to request more specific data using an optional ? string to change how results are sorted.
